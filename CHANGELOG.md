# Changelog

All entries describe actual repository changes, not promised simulator capabilities.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Real ngspice RC/lifecycle experiment with eight cases, three recorded local runs, analytical checks, a reference chart, and an opt-in Windows CI workflow.
- ADR 0007 records measured trial/callback, pause, reset, error, and worker-lifetime semantics; no coupled simulation is claimed.
- Pinned Windows backend packages, SHA-256 verifier, C++20 ngspice startup probe, reproducible setup guide, and SN-010 execution report.
- ADR 0006 and SN-019 for the verified native Windows Renode client incompatibility; E-02 external control requires that adaptation.
- English product requirements, architecture, backend/time contracts, and component/subcircuit design.
- Architecture decisions and a Windows-first roadmap targeting classroom use in February 2027.
- Backlog, risk register, open questions, and reproducible experiment specifications.
- MIT license for original project material and third-party review guidance.
- Development scaffolding, repository checks, and GitHub issue/PR/CI templates.
- Public repository under RicardoKers, with Ricardo Kerschbaumer as the initial author.
- Nine initial issues, four dated milestones, private vulnerability reporting, and main-branch protection requiring Windows/Ubuntu checks.

### Not implemented

Production simulation kernel/adapters, coupled backend integration, circuit editor, project loader, component runtime, and synchronized debugging.
